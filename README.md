# Long-term-performance-of-PurpleAir-PA-II-sensors-under-an-EPA-STAR-Grant
Code to reproduce results from the manuscript "AirSensor v1.0: Enhancements to the open-source R package to enable deep understanding of the long-term performance and reliability of PurpleAir sensors"

Inlcudes:

* Part 1 - Identify relevant sensors and create a local archive of data 
* Part 2 - Load the data from the local archive and process/organize for analysis and visualization, including: calculating a percent of data passing QA/QC per day, a cumulative runtime (in days), and an estimated cumulative expsoure or loading (in ug) 
* Part 3 - Results and plots for Section 3.1 
* Part 4 - Results and plots for Section 3.2
* Part 5 - Results and plots for Section 3.3
* Part 6 - Results and plots for Section 3.4

The code also notes all libraries requried in addition to the AirSensor package, and the versions used.
